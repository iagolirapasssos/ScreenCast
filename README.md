# ScreenCast Extension for MIT App Inventor

**ScreenCast** is an extension designed exclusively for screen mirroring and related settings on Android devices. This extension was inspired by a question in the [MIT App Inventor Community](https://community.appinventor.mit.edu/t/hi-i-needed-help-in-screen-cast/120962/3) and simplifies the process of integrating screen casting features into your apps.

With **ScreenCast**, you can:
- Open the system's screen mirroring settings.
- Stop active screen mirroring sessions by navigating to the appropriate settings.
- Enable or disable logging for debugging purposes.
